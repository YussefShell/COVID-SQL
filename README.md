COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Overview
This repository showcases an in-depth SQL analysis performed on global COVID-19 data, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. The project utilizes Microsoft MySQL to explore complex relationships within the data to uncover insights into the pandemicâ€™s impact and vaccination efforts.

Data Sources
The datasets used in this project include detailed records from:

CovidDeaths.csv and CovidDeaths.xlsx: Contain daily updates on COVID-19 deaths by country.
CovidVaccinations.csv and CovidVaccinations.xlsx: Provide data on COVID-19 vaccination doses administered worldwide.
Project Structure
COVID Portfolio Project - Data Exploration.sql: Contains all SQL queries used for the data analysis.
SQL Techniques Employed
The analysis demonstrates various SQL techniques and best practices, including:

Basic Data Retrieval: Filter and order operations to prepare datasets.
Complex Calculations: Mortality and infection rate analyses to understand the severity and spread of the virus.
Data Joining: Merging death and vaccination data to evaluate the progress of vaccination campaigns relative to case numbers.
Window Functions: Used for rolling calculations such as cumulative vaccinations.
Temporary Tables and Views: For efficient data manipulation and easier future analyses.
Analysis Highlights
Mortality Rate Calculation: Evaluates the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in various locations.
Infection Rate Analysis: Determines what percentage of the population has been infected with COVID-19.
Vaccination Analysis: Analyzes the cumulative percentage of populations vaccinated over time, using advanced window functions.
Tools and Technologies
Microsoft MySQL: Primary database platform for executing SQL queries.
Excel: Utilized for preliminary data cleaning and formatting.
Acknowledgments
